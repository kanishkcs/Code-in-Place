# Code-in-Place
Stanford University offered CS106A course in the form of '"Code in Place" during the COVID-19 pandemic. This was a virtual course in which Prof. Mehran Sahami and Prof. Chris Piech taught us for 5 weeks in which we completed 3 Assignments and a Final Project.
This is a well organised collection of all the notes and assignments for CS-106A.
Anyone can use it for revision or learning Python.
